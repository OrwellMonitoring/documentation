To develop new 5G applications, researchers need to test them. However, the price of 5G infrasctructure and the required expertise to assemble a fully functional testbed may be a barrier that some cannot overcome. This led to the creation of 5G testbeds with state-of-the-art technology which allow NetApp developers to have access to the required infrastructure to test their applications without having to worry about all the deployment process. These tests require a controlled environment, thus all the infrastructure has to be monitored. This work discusses an approach that complies with 5GASP directives and centralizes all the information on a unique time-series database. Moreover, the proposed methodologies were implemented in a proof of concept product which demonstrates the potential of the proposed approach on a working testbed.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"metrics-export/create-os-boot-service":{"id":"metrics-export/create-os-boot-service","title":"How to create an OS boot service","description":"Introduction","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"pythonPackage":{"id":"pythonPackage","title":"Python Package","description":"About","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"security/infection-monkey":{"id":"security/infection-monkey","title":"Infection Monkey","description":"Infection Monkey is a network breaching simulation tool which finds and reports flaws and exploits in the nodes of a network.
